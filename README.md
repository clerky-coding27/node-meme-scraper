#Node Meme Scraper

##Task
Create a cli (Command Line Interface) application that scrapes the current version of this website: memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app

...and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project. The image files should be named with a number with a leading zero, eg. 01.jpg, 02.jpg, etc.

Avoid using an "image scraper" or "image downloader" library that does multiple steps at once for you (eg. do not use image-downloader or nodejs-file-downloader or similar) - break the task down into smaller steps and select libraries as necessary for each step.

Make sure that the meme images are "ignored" in Git - they should not show up in your repository.

The program should be able to run multiple times without throwing an error.
